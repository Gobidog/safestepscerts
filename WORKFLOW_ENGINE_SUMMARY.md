| Help System | Keyboard shortcuts | Contextual help | Advanced settings |
| Target User | Power users | Beginners | Experienced users |
| Estimated Time | 2-3 minutes | 5-8 minutes | 8-15 minutes |

## User Behavior Tracking

The system tracks:
- **Feature Usage**: Which features users interact with most
- **Step Completion Times**: How long users spend on each step
- **Workflow Patterns**: Preferred modes and common workflows
- **Error Recovery**: Failed attempts and successful resolutions

This data enables:
- **Smart Suggestions**: Recommend preferred workflow modes
- **Personalized Dashboards**: Show relevant widgets and quick actions
- **Performance Insights**: Help users improve their efficiency
- **Product Analytics**: Understand usage patterns for future improvements

## Demo Capabilities

The workflow engine demo showcases:

1. **Mode Selection**: Smart suggestions based on user history
2. **Live Workflows**: Real-time step progression with visual feedback
3. **Save/Resume**: Demonstrate persistence across sessions
4. **Analytics**: Show user performance and usage patterns
5. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface
6. **Keyboard Navigation**: Power user shortcuts and accessibility

## Performance Characteristics

- **Creation Speed**: 10 workflows created and processed in < 0.01 seconds
- **Memory Efficient**: Dataclasses with minimal overhead
- **Scalable Storage**: JSON-based persistence with user namespacing
- **Auto-save Optimization**: Configurable intervals to balance performance and data safety

## Future Extension Points

The architecture supports easy extension for:
- **Custom Step Types**: Define domain-specific workflow steps
- **Integration Hooks**: Connect with external systems at step boundaries
- **Advanced Analytics**: Machine learning insights on user behavior
- **Collaboration Features**: Multi-user workflows and approval processes
- **Template Workflows**: Pre-configured workflows for common use cases

## Success Metrics
