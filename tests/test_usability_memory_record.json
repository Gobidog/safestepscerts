  "content": "TEST WRITER-FIXER AGENT: Successfully created comprehensive usability testing suite for SafeSteps UI redesign. Implemented 4 complete test suites using Playwright automation: 1) Button Touch Target Testing - validates WCAG 2.2 AA compliance with 44px minimum touch targets across mobile/tablet/desktop, 2) Workflow Completion Rate Testing - measures 90%+ completion rates across Quick/Guided/Advanced modes with save/resume functionality, 3) Navigation Efficiency Testing - validates Work/Manage/Monitor consolidation reduces clicks by 70% for common tasks, 4) Information Architecture Testing - verifies 8-page consolidation into 3 areas reduces cognitive load. Created SafeStepsUsabilityTester class with multi-viewport testing, automated login, performance monitoring, accessibility validation, and comprehensive JSON reporting. Tests align with EXECUTION_PLAN.md success criteria and address project memory findings of button visibility crisis, navigation complexity, workflow rigidity, and mobile UX failure. Delivered tests/test_usability.py with pytest integration and TEST_REPORT.md with execution guidance.",
