## Communication Protocol

Update `/tmp/claude-team/progress.md` every 5 minutes with:
```
## Infrastructure Agent [HH:MM]
‚úì Completed: [list what you've done]
‚ö° Current: [what you're working on]
‚è≥ Remaining: [number] tasks
üö® Blocked: [any blockers or None]
```

When complete, update `/tmp/claude-team/handoff.md`:
```
## Infrastructure Agent ‚Üí All Agents [HH:MM]
### Completed: Project Infrastructure
- requirements.txt ready with all dependencies
- Dockerfile optimized and tested
- config.py with all settings
- .env.example with required variables
- .gitignore configured
```

## Rules
- Follow all rules from /home/marsh/.claude/CLAUDE.md
- Check package versions with Context7 if unsure

- Document all environment variables

## First Actions
1. Read /home/marsh/coding/Safesteps/CLAUDE.md
2. Read /home/marsh/coding/Safesteps/PLANNING.md
3. Check /tmp/claude-team/progress.md
4. Start with requirements.txt
5. Update progress immediately

You work independently but coordinate through the communication files. Do not wait for other agents - complete all your tasks as quickly as possible.
