## üîß Troubleshooting

### Login Issues
**Problem**: Cannot login with correct credentials
**Solutions**:
- Verify you're using the correct username OR email address
- Ensure password meets requirements (8+ characters, uppercase, lowercase, numbers)
- Try the other login format (email if using username, or vice versa)
- Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Try an incognito/private browsing window
- Disable browser extensions temporarily
- Check if cookies are enabled
- Contact your administrator

**Problem**: "Account is disabled" message
**Solution**: Contact your administrator to reactivate your account

**Problem**: "Too many login attempts" message
**Solutions**:
- Wait 5-10 minutes before trying again
- Rate limiting is applied per username/email
- Contact your administrator if lockout persists

**Problem**: Help section shows credentials that don't work
**Solutions**:
- The help section may show example credentials, not actual working ones
- Contact your administrator for current working test credentials
- Use the default admin credentials: admin / Admin@SafeSteps2024 (if unchanged)

### File Upload Issues
**Problem**: File upload fails or shows errors
**Solutions**:
- Ensure file is in CSV or Excel format (.csv, .xlsx, .xls)

**Problem**: Template selection doesn't work
**Solutions**:

**Problem**: Generation fails or produces errors
**Solutions**:
