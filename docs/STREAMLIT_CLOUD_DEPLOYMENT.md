# Streamlit Cloud Deployment Guide

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: As of July 2025, the application includes enhanced configuration validation that will immediately alert you if JWT_SECRET is not configured, preventing deployment confusion.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying to Streamlit Cloud, ensure you have:
- A GitHub repository with your application code
- A Streamlit Cloud account (free at share.streamlit.io)
- Generated a secure JWT_SECRET token (instructions below)

## Step 1: Generate JWT_SECRET

Generate a secure JWT_SECRET token by running:

```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

Save this token - you'll need it in Step 3.

## Step 2: Deploy to Streamlit Cloud

1. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
2. Click "New app"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Select the branch and main file (app.py)
5. Click "Deploy"

**Expected behavior**: The app will deploy but show a configuration error. This is normal and expected! The error message will guide you to configure JWT_SECRET in the next step.

## Step 3: Configure Secrets (CRITICAL)

üî¥ **The app will not work until you complete this step!**

After deployment, you MUST configure the JWT_SECRET. The app will display clear instructions, but here's what to do:

1. When you first visit your deployed app, you'll see:
   ```
   üö® Configuration Error
   JWT_SECRET environment variable is not set!
   
   üì± Streamlit Cloud Users:
   1. Go to your app settings
   2. Click 'Secrets' in the menu
   3. Add: JWT_SECRET = "your-generated-secret"
   4. Redeploy your app
   ```

2. Go to your app's dashboard on Streamlit Cloud
3. Click the three dots menu (‚ãÆ) next to your app
4. Select "Settings"
5. Click on "Secrets" in the left sidebar
6. Add the following configuration:

```toml
# Required for authentication
JWT_SECRET = "your-generated-secret-from-step-1"

# Optional: Override default passwords
ADMIN_PASSWORD = "YourSecureAdminPassword123!"
USER_PASSWORD = "YourSecureUserPassword123!"

# Optional: Cloud storage configuration
USE_LOCAL_STORAGE = "true"
# GCS_PROJECT_ID = "your-project-id"
# GCS_BUCKET_NAME = "your-bucket-name"
```

6. Click "Save"
7. Your app will automatically restart with the new configuration

## Step 4: Verify Deployment

1. Visit your deployed app URL
2. You should see the login page without any configuration errors
3. Test login with the default credentials:
   - Admin: `admin` / `Admin@SafeSteps2024` (or your custom ADMIN_PASSWORD)
   - User: `testuser` / `Test@User2024`

## Common Issues

### "Configuration Error: JWT_SECRET not set"

**This is the expected behavior on first deployment!** The application now includes smart configuration validation that:
- Detects when JWT_SECRET is missing
- Shows platform-specific instructions
- Prevents confusing authentication errors later

Simply follow the instructions shown in the error message or Step 3 above.

### "Invalid username/password"

If using custom passwords, ensure they're correctly set in Streamlit Cloud secrets and match what you're entering.

### App crashes on startup

Check the logs in Streamlit Cloud dashboard for specific error messages. Common causes:
- Missing dependencies in requirements.txt
- Incorrect Python version
- File path issues (use relative paths)

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit secrets to GitHub** - Always use Streamlit Cloud secrets
2. **Use strong passwords** - Generate secure passwords for production
3. **Rotate JWT_SECRET regularly** - Update every 90 days
4. **Monitor access logs** - Check app logs for suspicious activity
5. **Limit admin accounts** - Only create admin users when necessary
