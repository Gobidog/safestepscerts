## üìä Issues by Severity Level

### CRITICAL (System Blocking)
**Impact**: Prevents complete system verification and user workflow testing

#### Issue C1: Authentication System Implementation Mismatch
- **Problem**: Current auth.py implementation differs significantly from CODE_CHANGES_COMPLETE.md documentation
- **Impact**: Cannot authenticate test users to complete verification workflows
- **Evidence**: Different function signatures, user management systems, and credential formats
- **Business Impact**: Unable to verify complete user experience and system reliability
- **Timeline**: IMMEDIATE - Blocks all end-to-end testing

#### Issue C2: Non-Working Test Credentials in Help System
- **Problem**: Login help section displays credentials that don't work with actual system
- **Impact**: Users cannot log in using documented test credentials
- **Evidence**: Help shows "user/SafeSteps2024!" but system expects different format
- **Business Impact**: User frustration, inability to test system functionality
- **Timeline**: IMMEDIATE - Affects all user testing

### HIGH (Significant Impact)
**Impact**: Reduces system reliability and user confidence

#### Issue H1: Inconsistent User Management Documentation
- **Problem**: Multiple authentication systems documented vs. implemented
- **Impact**: Confusion for developers and administrators
- **Evidence**: UserStore with bcrypt vs. simple password validation documented
- **Business Impact**: Development inefficiency, maintenance complexity
- **Timeline**: 1-2 days - Needs documentation alignment

#### Issue H2: Unknown Test User Passwords
- **Problem**: Test users exist but passwords are bcrypt hashed and unknown
- **Impact**: Cannot perform role-based testing (admin vs. user workflows)
- **Evidence**: testuser account has encrypted password with no documentation
- **Business Impact**: Incomplete testing coverage, reduced quality assurance
- **Timeline**: 1 day - Needs password reset or documentation

### MEDIUM (Moderate Impact)
**Impact**: Affects user experience but doesn't block core functionality

#### Issue M1: Help Section Password Requirements Mismatch
- **Problem**: Help text doesn't explain actual password strength requirements
- **Impact**: Users may create passwords that don't meet system requirements
- **Evidence**: System enforces 8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, numbers but help doesn't specify
- **Business Impact**: User registration/password change failures
- **Timeline**: 1 day - Documentation update needed

#### Issue M2: Login Format Confusion
- **Problem**: Users may not understand they can use email OR username
- **Impact**: Login failures due to format confusion
- **Evidence**: System accepts both but interface doesn't clearly indicate this
- **Business Impact**: Reduced user satisfaction, increased support requests
- **Timeline**: 1 day - UI/documentation improvement

### LOW (Minor Impact)
**Impact**: Cosmetic or documentation issues

#### Issue L1: Outdated Documentation Version Info
- **Problem**: Multiple documentation files have outdated version information
- **Impact**: Confusion about which documentation is current
- **Evidence**: VERSION_FAILED.md references older authentication approaches
- **Business Impact**: Minor confusion for technical users
- **Timeline**: 1 day - Version information cleanup
