## Logging In

### For Regular Users

1. **Navigate to the Login Page**
   - Open the SafeSteps Certificate Generator in your browser
   - You'll be presented with the login screen

2. **Enter Your Credentials**
   - **Username or Email**: Enter either your username OR email address

3. **Click Login**
   - If successful, you'll be welcomed and redirected to the certificate generation page

### Login Tips
- Passwords are case-sensitive
- You can use either your username OR email to log in
- Your session will remain active for 30 minutes of inactivity
- Multiple failed login attempts may result in temporary account lockout

## Password Requirements

All passwords must meet these security requirements:
- Minimum 8 characters long
- At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
- At least one lowercase letter (a-z)
- At least one number (0-9)

Example of a valid password: `SecurePass123`

## Common Login Issues

### "Invalid username/email or password"
- Double-check your username/email spelling
- Ensure your password is typed correctly (check Caps Lock)
- Try using your email if username doesn't work, or vice versa

### "Account is inactive"
- Your account has been deactivated by an administrator
- Contact your administrator to reactivate your account

### "Too many failed login attempts"
- Wait a few minutes before trying again
- Contact an administrator if you've forgotten your password

## Session Management

- Sessions automatically expire after 30 minutes of inactivity
- You'll need to log in again after session expiration
- Your work is automatically saved before session timeout
- You can log out manually using the logout button in the sidebar

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never share your password** with anyone
2. **Use a unique password** for SafeSteps (don't reuse passwords)
3. **Log out** when finished, especially on shared computers
4. **Report suspicious activity** to your administrator immediately
5. **Update your password** regularly (ask admin for password reset)
